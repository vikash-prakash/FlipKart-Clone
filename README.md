# FlipKart-Clone
It's a Flipkart that provides all of the functionality and design to the user, which took around 30 hours to develop. I've primarily concentrated on the frontend, and I'm thinking about the backend, which will be added later. I'm now working on the backend. Because I'm a newbie, I utilised HTML, CSS, and Javascript for this project. I'll switch to React after a while.
